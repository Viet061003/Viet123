				<h1>Espresso</h1>
				<p>A very popular coffee in Italy and Spain; It is made by passing water under high pressure through an extremely finely ground coffee. 
					The result will be 25 - 30ml of drink with a layer of cream from coffee oil with a dark brown color (it is called crema) 5mm thick on the surface. A real espresso will have a very strong taste and a layer of aromatic crema without bitterness. 
					Cafe Espresso is usually served in a pre-heated thick cup, with or without added sugar, and is usually served with a cookie and a glass of water.
